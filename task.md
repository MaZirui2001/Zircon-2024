Hello, everyone. My name is MaZirui. Today, my groupmates and I will introduce something of AI for you. Have you ever use AI to help you with your work or you homework? I think the answer is yes. During the time spending with AI, have you ever experienced the strength and convenience of AI? For example, ask AI to reduce the AI rate of your essay. It seems that AI is going to replace human beings in many fields, and can do everything for us. Is that really the case? Here, I will show you some fun stories and personal opinions about AI.

For this speech, I have trained an agent, do you know what is agent? Agent is something with intelligence. I just want to see what is AI really good at. So here, do you know what's this? I think our teacher may be familiar with it. It's the work of William Shakespeare. I use this as the trainning data for my agent. What I want to do is to see that after studying the work of Shakespeare, can my agent fill this blank: To be or not to be, that is the what. That is the question. This is a famous sentence from Shakespeare's play "Hamlet". So after experiencing the emotion and writing style of Shakespeare, can my agent answer this question with the accurate word "question", or some word with similar meaning? Let's see.

Here is my trainning process. As you can see, I trained my agent with the complete works of Shakespeare. Attention! The trainning set doesn't contain the sentence. What I want to do is to make the agent infer the sentence, not just refer to something to complete the sentence. I trained my agent for just one day. As we all know, for popular models such as ChatGPT or Deepseek, they commonly need to be trained for several days or weeks. But here, I only trained my agent for one day. My agent is based on the Transformer architecture, just as the ChatGPT and Deepseek. During the training, the agent will experience the emotion and writing style of Shakespeare. After training, I will ask the agent this question, and expect it to answer with the accurate word "question" or something else.

Here is the result. As you can see, the agent said that to be or not to be, that is the want. You may say that 'want' and 'question' are not similar. But what you have to know is that, at the beginning, the agent even didn't know what is an English letter, let alone the meaning of the word, just like a baby that was just born. After one day of training, it can already answer this question, which cannot be true for a baby. And if you think it over, you may find 'want' is also make sense.

There is another result. Young mens love then lies not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes. The agent said in their head. You can find that the agent can already understand the meaning of the sentence. So from these experiments, we can see that the AI is really good at tasks with no definite answer or need creative thinking. In this aspect, after one day of training, an agent can get to the level of a human after years of learning. So do you still think that AI is just a tool for us? 

Yes it is! Because here is a joke made by ChatGPT: 9.11 and 9.9, which is greater? That is the question I asked to ChatGPT the day before yesterday. ChatGPT answered that 9.11 is greater and gave some reasons seemely reasonable. That is ridiculous, right? You may say that an agent that can get the emotion of Shakespeare surprisingly cannot do a math problem that a primary student can do, that is not true. But if we ask the same question to the Deepseek, you can see, it gave the correct answer. So here is the question: Is AI really know the formula of 'greater'? I will show you the detail.

Here is the answer. This is the rule of 'greater' which is taught in primary school. When you are a primary student, you firstly know the rule, then you use it to do many exercises in math. But AI is not like that. It cannot understand what is a rule, so you need to give it lots of examples to let it form a concept of 'greater'. However, for a strict definition of 'greater', although you give it plenty of examples, it maybe still cannot exactly understand the meaning defined by human beings. So maybe we can say that AI is not really good at tasks with definite answers and strict math rules.

Finally, let's come to the conclusion. AI is really good at tasks with no definite answers or need creative thinking. But it is not really good at tasks with definite answers and strict math rules. If someone asks me will AI replace human beings, I just want to say that, although AI can get the point of the Shakespeare's work in only one day, it still have to face the difficulty to fit in the world and society created by human beings. The only one can dominate the world is exactly the human beings, just is you and me.

Thank you for your listening.
